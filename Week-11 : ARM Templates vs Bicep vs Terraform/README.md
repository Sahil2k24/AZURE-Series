# ☁️ Azure Learning Journey – Week 11 🚀

**Topic:** *ARM Templates vs Bicep vs Terraform*

Welcome to **Week 11** of my Azure Series!
This week, I explored **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools in Azure, focusing on ARM Templates, Bicep, and Terraform—key to automating and scaling cloud infrastructure reliably.

---

## 📌 What I Learned

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

* ARM is Azure’s native deployment and management service, enabling declarative infrastructure provisioning.
* ARM Templates are JSON files that define Azure resources in a repeatable, automated way.

### Why Use ARM Templates?

* Ensures consistent and repeatable deployments
* Supports complex resource dependencies and parameterization
* Integrates with Azure CLI, PowerShell, and DevOps pipelines

### Writing & Deploying ARM Templates

* Step-by-step process of creating JSON templates
* Deployment via Azure CLI and PowerShell commands

## ⚔️ Bicep vs ARM Templates vs Terraform

| Feature             | ARM Templates            | Bicep                    | Terraform              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Syntax              | JSON (verbose)           | Declarative & concise    | HCL (HashiCorp Config) |
| Complexity          | High for large templates | Easier to read and write | Multi-cloud support    |
| Azure Native        | Yes                      | Yes (built on ARM)       | No (multi-cloud)       |
| State Management    | Azure handles state      | Azure handles state      | Requires state backend |
| Multi-Cloud Support | No                       | No                       | Yes                    |
| Tooling             | Azure CLI, PowerShell    | Azure CLI, PowerShell    | Terraform CLI          |

## 🤔 When to Use What?

* **ARM Templates:** Deep Azure integration, complex deployments, native tooling
* **Bicep:** Simplified authoring of ARM templates, faster development
* **Terraform:** Cross-cloud infrastructure, strong community, reusable modules

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* Modularize templates/Bicep files for reusability
* Use parameter files for environment-specific configs
* Manage state carefully (especially in Terraform)
* Integrate IaC in CI/CD pipelines for automation
