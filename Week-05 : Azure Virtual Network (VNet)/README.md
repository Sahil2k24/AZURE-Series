# 🌐 Azure Learning Journey – Week 5 ☁️🚀

**Topic:** *Azure Virtual Network (VNet) – Building Secure & Scalable Networks*

Welcome to **Week 5** of my Azure Series!
This week focused on one of the core building blocks of Azure infrastructure: **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)**. It's the backbone of secure communication between your cloud services.

---

## 🌐 What is Azure Virtual Network (VNet)?

Azure VNet is a **private, isolated network environment** where you can securely run and connect Azure resources like VMs, containers, and databases. It functions much like a traditional on-premises network but offers the **scalability and flexibility** of the cloud.

## ✅ Key Concepts Explored

### 🔒 Private Networking & Subnet Segmentation

* Created **subnets** within VNets to isolate different parts of applications (e.g., frontend, backend).
* Subnets improve **network hygiene**, **performance**, and **security**.

### 🔐 Traffic Control: NSGs & ASGs

* **Network Security Groups (NSGs):** Control **inbound/outbound traffic** to resources.
* **Application Security Groups (ASGs):** Group VMs logically for **simplified security rules**.

### 🚦 Custom Routes & Hybrid Connectivity

* Explored **User Defined Routes (UDRs)** for advanced routing logic.
* Understood options like **VPN Gateway** and **ExpressRoute** for **on-premises to Azure hybrid setups**.

---

## 🛡 Best Practices

* 🔹 **Subnet Segmentation:** Use dedicated subnets for app tiers (web, app, DB).
* 🔹 **NSGs for Access Control:** Apply at both **subnet** and **NIC** levels for tighter control.
* 🔹 **Monitor Network Traffic:** Use tools like **Network Watcher** to detect issues and optimize performance.

## 🧠 Skills Strengthened

* Designing secure network topologies
* Implementing layered security using NSGs and ASGs
* Creating custom routes and simulating hybrid connectivity
* Traffic monitoring and troubleshooting
