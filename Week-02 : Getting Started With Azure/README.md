# 🌐 Azure Learning Journey – Week 2 ☁️🚀

Welcome to **Week 2** of my **Microsoft Azure Series**, where I continue to expand my cloud knowledge beyond AWS and dive deeper into the **Azure ecosystem**.

---

## 📅 This Week’s Focus: Cloud Service Models & Azure Infrastructure

This week, I explored the **core building blocks** of Azure and gained hands-on experience with its global architecture and services. Below are the key areas I focused on:

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 🔑 Azure Account Setup

* Created and configured my **Azure account** to start experimenting with various services.
* Explored the **Azure Portal** and **Azure CLI** for managing resources.

### 🌍 Azure Global Infrastructure

* **Regions & Availability Zones**

  * Learned how Azure distributes its **data centers globally** to provide low-latency access and disaster recovery.
  * Understood how **availability zones** contribute to fault tolerance and high availability.

### 🧱 Cloud Service Models

* **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**

  * Gives users full control over infrastructure (e.g., VMs, networking).
  * Ideal for lift-and-shift workloads.

* **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**

  * Simplifies development with a managed platform for building, testing, and deploying apps.
  * No need to manage the underlying infrastructure.

* **SaaS (Software as a Service)**

  * Fully managed applications delivered over the internet (e.g., Microsoft 365).
  * Users consume the app without managing anything behind the scenes.

### 💡 Key Insights

* **High Availability** is achieved through **redundant data centers and zones**.
* Choosing the right **cloud service model** depends on the project requirements—**IaaS for flexibility**, **PaaS for productivity**, and **SaaS for simplicity**.
* Azure's **region-based architecture** helps reduce latency and improve performance for end users globally.
