# 🌐 Azure Learning Journey – Week 7 ☁️🚀

**Topic:** *Azure Networking Demo – Secure & Scalable Networking Components*

Welcome to **Week 7** of my Azure Series!
This week, I took a deep hands-on dive into **Azure Networking** components critical for building a robust and secure cloud infrastructure.

---

## 🔐 Key Components Explored

### Virtual Networks (VNet)

* Set up VNets with well-planned subnets for isolating workloads and controlling traffic flow.

### Network Security Groups (NSG)

* Configured NSGs to enforce fine-grained inbound and outbound traffic rules at subnet and NIC levels.

### Azure Firewall

* Deployed Azure Firewall for centralized, stateful network traffic filtering and threat protection.

### Azure Bastion

* Implemented **Azure Bastion** to securely connect to virtual machines over SSL without exposing public IP addresses or using VPNs.

### NAT Policies & Secure Access

* Configured Network Address Translation (NAT) policies to manage external access securely.

---

## 🚀 Hands-On Highlights

* Created secure subnet architectures combining NSGs and Firewall rules.
* Enabled secure VM access through Bastion, eliminating the risk of public IP exposure.
* Demonstrated network isolation and traffic flow control with practical examples.

## 🧠 Skills Enhanced

* Building secure Azure networking architectures
* Applying NSGs and Firewall configurations effectively
* Using Azure Bastion for secure, seamless VM connectivity
* Implementing NAT policies for external traffic management
