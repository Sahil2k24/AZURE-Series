# ðŸš€ Week 14: Azure DevOps Project â€“ From Absolute Zero (Part I)

Welcome to **Week 14** of my Azure Series! In this phase of the project, I focused on building the foundation for a DevOps pipeline using **Azure DevOps**, starting from scratch.

---

## ðŸ”§ What I Accomplished

### âœ… 1. Created a New Project in Azure DevOps

Set up a fresh project workspace to manage code, pipelines, and teams within the Azure DevOps ecosystem.

### âœ… 2. Configured Git Version Control

Initialized a Git repository in **Azure Repos** to enable source control and collaborative development.

### âœ… 3. Implemented Continuous Integration (CI)

Built an automated CI pipeline that triggers on every code push. This includes:

* Automated build processes
* Unit testing
* Code validation

### âœ… 4. Enforced Branch Policies

Defined branch protection rules such as:

* Requiring pull requests for changes to main
* Mandatory code reviews
* CI checks before merging

These policies ensure improved code quality and reduced chances of errors in production.

### âœ… 5. Managed Build Artifacts

Configured the pipeline to generate and store **build artifacts** that can later be used for deployment in the CD phase.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

Implementing a proper CI pipeline ensures that **every code change** is automatically:

* Built
* Tested
* Verified

This increases development efficiency and reduces deployment risk.

## ðŸ”œ Whatâ€™s Next

In the upcoming part of the series, Iâ€™ll dive into **Continuous Deployment (CD)** â€“ where we'll automate the release process and bring our builds to life in real environments. Stay tuned!
