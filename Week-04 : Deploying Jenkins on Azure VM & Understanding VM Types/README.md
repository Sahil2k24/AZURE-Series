# 🌐 Azure Learning Journey – Week 4 ☁️🚀

**Topic:** *Deploying Jenkins on Azure Virtual Machines & Understanding VM Types*

Welcome to **Week 4** of my **Microsoft Azure Series**!
This week was all about **Virtual Machines (VMs)** in Azure — from understanding how Azure handles virtualization to hands-on deployment of **Jenkins**, the popular automation server.

## 🔍 What I Explored

### 💻 Virtualization & Azure VM Fundamentals

* Learned how **Azure leverages hypervisors** to abstract physical hardware.
* Understood the key benefits of VMs for **flexible, scalable, and isolated** workloads.

### ⚙️ Choosing the Right VM Size

* Explored various **VM series** in Azure based on workload requirements:

  * **D-Series**: General-purpose, memory-optimized
  * **F-Series**: Compute-intensive, high CPU-to-memory ratio
  * **N-Series**: GPU-optimized for heavy compute workloads (AI/ML, rendering)

### 🚀 Jenkins Deployment on Azure VM

* Created and configured a **Linux VM** via Azure Portal.
* Connected to the VM using **SSH**, configured access permissions.
* Installed **Jenkins** with necessary dependencies (Java, Jenkins repo).
* Opened necessary **network ports** (e.g., 8080) using **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**.

### 🔐 Networking & Security Best Practices

* Configured firewall rules and **NSGs** to restrict public access to only required ports.
* Followed least-privilege access principles using **Azure RBAC**.

### 📈 Auto-scaling with Azure VM Scale Sets (VMSS)

* Understood how **VMSS** helps scale VMs automatically based on **CPU load, memory, or custom metrics**.
* Learned that it supports **load balancing** and **rolling updates** for VM instances.

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Azure offers a wide variety of VM types tailored for specific workloads.
* Jenkins deployment on a VM improves control and flexibility for **custom CI/CD pipelines**.
* VM Scale Sets are essential for **auto-scaling**, especially in production-grade systems with variable loads.
* Security and port configuration should always be **part of deployment planning**.
