# 🚀 Week 17: Deploy an E-Commerce Project on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) 🛒☁️

Welcome to Week 17 of the Azure Cloud Series! In this guide, we’ll walk through deploying a full-fledged e-commerce application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), covering everything from containerization to CI/CD automation and monitoring.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

* Containerize a multi-component e-commerce app
* Deploy it to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Automate builds and deployments using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps
* Set up autoscaling and monitoring with Azure Monitor and Prometheus

## 💡 Technologies Used

* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Docker
* Kubernetes (kubectl, Helm)
* Azure Container Registry (ACR)
* GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps
* Azure Monitor
* Prometheus + Grafana

---

## 🧱 Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Containerization

Containerize each application component (e.g., frontend, backend, database) using Docker. Create Dockerfiles for each service, define their dependencies, and build images.

### 2. Push Images to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Set up ACR in your Azure account. Tag and push the Docker images to ACR so they can be pulled by AKS during deployment.

### 3. Create an AKS Cluster

Provision an AKS cluster using the Azure CLI or portal. Ensure it's connected to your ACR to pull container images securely. Configure node scaling and monitoring addons.

### 4. Write Kubernetes Manifests

Create Kubernetes YAML manifests for:

* Deployments (to define your pods and replicas)
* Services (to expose your applications internally or externally)
* Ingress (for routing traffic to different services via domains)
* ConfigMaps and Secrets (for environment variables and credentials)

Apply them using `kubectl apply`.

### 5. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline

Use GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps to automate:

* Docker image builds
* Push to ACR
* AKS deployment updates

Configure pipeline triggers on code pushes or PR merges.

### 6. Configure Autoscaling and Monitoring

Enable cluster autoscaler on AKS to handle increased load. Integrate monitoring tools:

* Azure Monitor for performance and health insights
* Prometheus and Grafana for custom metrics and dashboards

## 📈 Benefits of Using AKS

* Simplified Kubernetes cluster management
* Built-in monitoring and logging
* Integrated CI/CD tooling
* Autoscaling for cost-effective performance
* Enhanced security with Azure policies

## 🔚 Conclusion

Deploying applications on AKS equips DevOps engineers and cloud developers with the tools needed to scale efficiently, maintain security, and automate deployment workflows. Mastering AKS is a powerful step toward building resilient cloud-native systems.
