# 🚀 Week 15: Ultimate Azure CI/CD Pipeline with Azure Pipelines & Argo CD

Welcome to **Week 15** of my Azure Series!
This week, I explored how to build a **robust CI/CD pipeline** for a **multi-microservice project** using **Azure Pipelines** and **Argo CD**. The goal: to enable secure, scalable, and fully automated deployments across Kubernetes clusters.

---

## 🎯 Project Focus

Building a **CI/CD workflow** that combines the power of **Azure DevOps** and **GitOps** using Argo CD for production-grade Kubernetes deployments.

---

## 🔍 Key Highlights

* ✅ **Azure Pipelines** for automated builds, testing, and deployment
* ✅ **Argo CD** for GitOps-based continuous delivery to Kubernetes
* ✅ **Secrets management** and **auto-scaling** for security and performance
* ✅ **Blue-Green** and **Canary deployments** to enable zero-downtime releases
* ✅ **Monitoring and logging** integration with:

  * Prometheus
  * Grafana
  * Azure Monitor

## 💡 Why This Matters

Combining Azure Pipelines and Argo CD:

* Reduces manual effort
* Improves deployment speed and reliability
* Encourages team collaboration
* Supports progressive delivery strategies

---

## 🧠 What I Gained

* Deep understanding of multi-stage CI/CD flows
* Real-world GitOps implementation at scale
* Deployment strategies for high availability and reduced risk
* Best practices for production-grade Kubernetes management
