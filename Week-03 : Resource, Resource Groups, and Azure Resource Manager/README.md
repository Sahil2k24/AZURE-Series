# 🌐 Azure Learning Journey – Week 3 ☁️🚀

**Topic:** *Resources, Resource Groups, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM)*

Welcome to **Week 3** of my Azure series! This week was all about getting hands-on with **Azure resources**, understanding how to **organize them effectively**, and learning how **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)** acts as the foundation for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure.

---

## 🧱 Core Concepts Explored

### 📌 Resources & Resource Groups

* In Azure, everything from **Virtual Machines** to **Storage Accounts**, **Databases**, and **Network Interfaces** is considered a **resource**.
* **Resource Groups** act as logical containers that:

  * Help organize and manage related resources
  * Enable **role-based access control (RBAC)**
  * Simplify **monitoring** and **cost management**
  * Assist in lifecycle and policy management

### 🛠 Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

* ARM is the **deployment and management service** for Azure.
* It provides a **consistent management layer**—whether you're using the **Azure Portal**, **Azure CLI**, **PowerShell**, or **SDKs/APIs**.
* ARM allows users to deploy resources declaratively using **ARM templates** (in JSON or Bicep).

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* 📂 **Resource Groups** are **mandatory** for resource creation and are essential for organizing, securing, and tracking Azure assets.
* 🧠 **ARM** abstracts the backend complexity, allowing users to **orchestrate infrastructure as code**, automate deployments, and apply policies consistently.
* 💰 Using **structured resource groups** helps with **cost control**, **auditing**, and **streamlining operations**.
