# 🌐 Azure Learning Journey – Week 6 ☁️🚀

**Topic:** *Azure Networking Basics to Advanced*

Welcome to **Week 6** of my Azure Series!
This week’s focus was on mastering the **full spectrum of Azure networking**—a critical component to build secure, scalable, and highly available cloud architectures.

## 🔍 What I Covered

### 🏗️ Virtual Networks (VNets) & Subnets

* Recapped foundational networking with VNets and subnet segmentation for resource isolation and traffic control.

### ⚖️ Azure Load Balancer & Application Gateway

* Explored **Azure Load Balancer** for distributing traffic at the transport layer (TCP/UDP).
* Delved into **Application Gateway**, an HTTP load balancer with advanced routing, SSL termination, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration.

### 🔥 Web Application Firewall (WAF)

* Understood how **WAF protects web apps** by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic to block common web exploits.

### 🛡️ Azure DNS & Firewall

* Configured **Azure DNS** to manage domain names with high availability and performance.
* Explored **Azure Firewall** for centralized network security and threat protection.

### 🌍 VNet Peering & VPN Gateway for Hybrid Connectivity

* Learned about **VNet Peering** to connect VNets securely and seamlessly.
* Configured **VPN Gateway** to enable encrypted site-to-site and point-to-site connections between Azure and on-premises networks.

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Azure networking provides multiple layers of traffic management from simple load balancing to complex application routing.
* Security is integrated at every layer with WAF, Firewall, and NSGs.
* Hybrid connectivity options like VPN Gateway and VNet Peering enable flexible multi-environment architectures.
